## Overview

The flag patterns are largely based on actual national and city flags, with variations that may not be in use.

Click on a flag to see a formulaic (and possibly inaccurate) vexillological description and cross references to existing flags using this pattern.

## Ideas

François Best's [Representing SHA-256 Hashes As Avatars](https://francoisbest.com/posts/2021/hashvatars) inspired me to think about flags as avatars. Square flags at small sizes are easily distinguishable. This could be an interesting application.

## Acknowledgements

This started as a hack, written completely client-side, and so a few files were copied in directly.

* https://chir.ag/projects/ntc/ - Name that Color functionality used to describe the flag colors; this uses a huge palette, and could more usefully be restricted to a simple color palette
